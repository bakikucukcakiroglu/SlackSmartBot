# SlackSmartBot

Welcome to the Google Cloud Functions project for integrating Slack and OpenAI! This project allows users to send messages to a Slack channel and receive responses from the OpenAI API through a Google Cloud Function.

## The project consists of three main components:

- **Slack**: Webhooks to send and receive messages to/from a Slack channel.  
- **OpenAI**: To generate responses to the incoming messages.  
- **Google Cloud Functions**: To connect Slack and OpenAI and handle the message processing and database operations.

## Project flow:

- A user sends a message to the Slack channel.  
- SlackSmartBot receives the message through an outgoing webhook and checks the cloud database for a stored response.  
- If a stored response is found, SlackSmartBot returns it to the Slack channel.  
- If no stored response is found, SlackSmartBot sends the message to the OpenAI API and stores the incoming message and response in the cloud database.  
- SlackSmartBot writes the response from the OpenAI API to the Slack channel.

## Setup:

To use this project, you will need to do the following:  

- Set up a Slack channel and configure **webhooks** to receive and send messages to the Google Cloud Function.  
- Set up a Google Cloud Functions project and deploy the provided code.  
- Set up a Google Cloud Firestore database and configure the Google Cloud Function to use it.  
- Obtain an **API key** for the OpenAI API and configure it in the Google Cloud Function.  

## Usage:

To use the project, simply send a message to the configured Slack channel. SlackSmartBot will process the message and return a response through the incoming webhooks.

## Conclusion:

We hope that this project will be useful for integrating Slack and OpenAI in your own projects. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.
